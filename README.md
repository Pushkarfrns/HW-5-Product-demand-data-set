# HW-5-Product-demand-data-set
repository created for HW5: forecasting models
Notebook: LabProject#5_Product-demand-Forecasting.ipynb Purpose: Deduced Additional Information and ARIMA time series forecasting to
predict sales/demand for wahrehouseA.

Loaded the Historical Product Demand.csv in a dataframes.

* *Additional Information #1*: To find total number of products that belong to each category.
* Viusalization: Plotted a graph, number of products against each category of products
Converted the above new data into a new data frame (df_nba_elo_No_of_matches_each_day).

Saved the resulted dataframe in a csv (AdditionalInfo#1_Count_Of_Match_Played_dateWise.csv)

Additional Information #2: To find total number of matches played in each season.
Converted the above new data into a dataframe (df_nba_elo_Match_per_season).

Saved the resulted dataframe in a csv (AdditionalInfo#2_SeasonWise_MatchCount.csv).

Additional Information #3: To find the mean score for all the team1.
Converted the above new data into a dataframe (df_nba_elo_MeanScore_Team1)

Saved the resulted dataframe in a csv (AdditionalInfo#3_MeanScore_for_AllTeam1.csv)

Additional Information #4: To find the mean score for all the team2.
Converted the above new data into a dataframe (df_nba_elo_MeanScore_Team2)

Saved the resulted dataframe in a csv (AdditionalInfo#4_MeanScore_for_AllTeam2.csv)

Additional Information #5: Created 3 new columns namely year, month and date for each of the match played.

Additional Information #6: To find for each year how many matches were played.

Converted the above new data into a dataframe (df_nba_elo_newYEAR )

Saved the resulted dataframe in a csv (AdditionalInfo#6_NumberOfMatchesPlayedYearWise.csv)

Additional Information #7: To find for each month how many matches were played.
Converted the above new data into a dataframe (df_nba_elo_newMonth )

Saved the resulted dataframe in a csv (AdditionalInfo#7_NumberOfMatchesPlayedMonthWise.csv)

Additional Information #8: To find for each month how many matches were played.
Converted the above new data into a dataframe (df_nba_elo_newDate )

Saved the resulted dataframe in a csv (AdditionalInfo#8_NumberOfMatchesPlayedDateWise.csv)

My findings -->

On dates 2013-04-17, 2016-11-25, 2014-04-16, 2009-01-02, 2011-04-13	maximum number of 15 matches were played.
For season 2014 and 2016 maximum number of matches were playes i.e. 1319 matches.
Among all the team1, DNA has the maximum mean score of 125.132653
Among all the team2, WSA has the maximum mean score of 120.421053
In year 2012, maximum number of 1474 matches were played.
For all the seasons, the maximum number of matches were played in March i.e. 11877 matches.
Maximum number of matches were played/held during start or end of the month.
Random Forest: Regression Analysis

In order to apply random forest, changed the datatype of team1 and team2 column (object type) to int
Find the labels and stored them separately i.e. the score we wanted to predict.
Remove the labels from the features
Saving feature names for later use.
To convert the dataframe to numpy array.
Used Skicit-learn to split data into training and testing sets.
Imported the random forest model.
Instantiated the model with 1000 decision trees
Trained the model on training data
Used the forest's predict method on the test data
Calculated the absolute errors
Printed the mean absolute error (mae) i.e. 5.16 degree
Calculated mean absolute percentage error (MAPE)
Accuracy: 94.71 %.
